## Must Haves
- *User Authentication*: Users should be able to register, log in and manage their profile.
- *Real-Time Stock Data fetching*: The backend should fetch stock data from an API (Alpha Vantage, Yahoo Finance) using Go Routines
- *Search and Filter*: Users should be able to search for for stocks by ticker symbol, company name, or industry
- *Database Storage*: Store user portfolios and historical stock data in PostgreSQL (with caching in Redis).
